1) Cities in the northern hemisphere have a negative correlation between latitude and maximum temperatuere while those in the southern hemipshere have a positive one. This coincides with the typical belief that places in the northern hemisphere are generally going to be colder, and vice versa for the southern hemisphere.
2) However, cities in the both the northern and southern hemispheres have flat correlations for all other comparisons, suggesting that variability is far more conditional when investigating wind speed, humidity, and cloudiness.
3) Thus, it can be inferred that latitude is a greater indicator of temperature than other weather measurements, with perhaps wind speed coming in second.
